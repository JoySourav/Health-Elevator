# Health-Elevator
The main goal of this project was to create a program that teaches people about the healthy diet intake in a quiz fashion and also helps them to keep track of their daily calorie intake. This is a Java program.
This program is very helpful to learn the basics of Java. The beginners can refer to the different styles,data structures and algorithms used in the program to learn how to begin building an app from scratch.
The project was created by Sourav Das and completely for educational purpose only. The users are highly discouraged to copy or reuse the code for any personal project.
